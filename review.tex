\section{Review of discretizations for polygonal meshes} \label{sec_review}
In this section, we review discretizations that can be used on polygonal
meshes at the exception of the PWLD discretization which will be introduce in
the next Section.
\subsection{Palmer's method}
Palmer's method is a node- or point-based method \cite{Palmer2001}. The method
is second order. This discretization uses a finite volume approach: the
particle balance is enforced by integrating the diffusion equation over a
control volume. The control volume is the union of all corners surrounding the
specified point. A corner is a quadrilateral with vertices at the point $p$,
the cell-center $c$, and the midpoint of each of the edges $e$ that contain
the point $p$. On a triangular grid, the scheme is equivalent to linear
continuous finite elements with ``mass-matrix lumping. This method works for
any polygonal cell even concave polygon. The main disadvantage of the method
is that the system is not symmetric.
\subsection{Mimetic finite difference}
Mimetic methods, like mimetic finite difference, mimic properties of
mathematical and physical models, such as: tensor and vector calculus,
conservation laws, symmetry preservation, solution positivity and
monotonicity, and asymptotic limits (e.g., diffusion limit), on polygonal and
polyhedral meshes. The most important part of MFD is the definition of scalar
product which should satisfy stability and consistency conditions
\cite{Brezzi2005}. However, this scalar product is not unique. MFD is
efficient event on concave polygons \cite{Kuznetsov2004}. MFD method is
related to mixed finite elements.

%\red{An important (mimetic) property of operators div and $K\bn$ is expressed
%  by integration by part formula:
%  \begin{equation}
%    \int_{\bo} K^{-1}\bs{u} \cdot (K\bn p)dV = - \int_{\bo} (div\ \bs{u}) p\ dV
%  \end{equation}
%  which holds for any $p \in H_0^1(\bo)$ and $\bs{u}\in H_{div}(\bo)$.\\
%  The MFD method mimics this property by replacing integrals and operators by
%  their discrete counterparts:
%  \begin{equation}
%    [\bs{U},GRAD\ P]_X = -[DIV\ \bs{U},P]_Q
%  \end{equation}
%which holds for any vectors of degrees of freedom $P$ and $\bs{U}$. MFD
%connected to mixed finite elements. Works with mixed cells.}
%\red{Mimetic numerical methods mimic crucial properties of mathematical and
%  physical models on arbitrary on polygonal and polyhedral meshes:
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item tensor and vector calculus
%    \item conservation laws
%    \item symmetry preservation
%    \item solution positivity and monotonicity
%    \item asymptotic limits (e.g., diffusion limit in radiation transport
%      models)
%  \end{itemize}}
%\red{\cite{Lipnikov2004} only quadrilaterals with at most one hanging node per edge. 
%  SO can be applied to many forms of the diffusion equation, but here we consider
%the first-order form of the diffusion equation. Use local SO.
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item there are two different support-operators methods, they both
%        give the same cell-center intensity solutions:
%    \begin{itemize}
%      \item one has intensity unknowns located only at cell centers: the
%        diffusion matrix is dense.
%      \item one has intensity unknowns located at both cell centers and face
%        centers: the diffusion matrix is space. The cell-center unknowns are
%        locally eliminated, resulting in a reduced system consisting only of
%        the face-center unknowns. The method is called the local SO method.
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item local SO is composed of two steps:
%    \begin{itemize}
%      \item consider each cell in the domain as a independent domain and
%        generate an independent discretization for each cell (identical to
%        what is done for standard quadrilateral meshes)
%      \item obtain a global discretization by imposing continuity of the
%        intensity and continuity of the normal component of the flux across
%        cell interfaces. 
%    \end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%\cite{Hyman2002} the mimetic FDM are based on discrete of first-order
%coordinate-invariant operators, it is natural to write the diffusion equation
%as a system of first order equations.
%\cite{Kuznetsov2004} works for any polygons. Used in geophysics $->$ the equation is
%split in two first-order equations.
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item exact for linear solution
%  \item SPD
%\end{itemize}
%\cite{Brezzi2005} the key element of the MFD method is the scalar product in the
%space of discrete velocities which should satisfy the stability assumption and
%the consistency assumption. It turns out that such a scalar product is not
%unique.
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item specify the degrees of freedom for the primary variables
%  \item define suitable scalar products in the discrete spaces
%  \item discretize the divergence operator
%  \item define the discrete flux operator
%\end{enumerate}}
\subsection{Wachspress' rationale finite element}
The disadvantages of this method is that it works only for convex cells and
the basis function integrals must be done numerically \cite{Bailey2008a}.
Before we introduce the basis function for a quadrilateral cell, we define:
\begin{equation}
  P_{1,2}(x,y) = (y-y_1) (x_2-x_1)-(x-x_1)(y_2-y_1).
\end{equation}  
The basis functions are given by:
\begin{align}
  &b_0(x,y) = k_0 P_{2,3}(x,y)P_{1,2}(x,y)/P_{4,5}(x,y),\\
  &b_1(x,y) = k_1 P_{0,3}(x,y)P_{2,3}(x,y)/P_{4,5}(x,y),\\
  &b_2(x,y) = k_2 P_{0,1}(x,y)P_{3,0}(x,y)/P_{4,5}(x,y),\\
  &b_3(x,y) = k_3 P_{1,2}(x,y)P_{0,1}(x,y)/P_{4,5}(x,y),
\end{align}
where $k_i$ are chose such that $b_i(x_i,y_i)=1$. $(x_4,y_4)$ and $(x_5,y_5)$
are the two points which are the intersection of the lines created by the edges of the
quadrilaterals (see \Cref{fig_quadrilateral}).
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{quadrilateral}
  \caption{Quadrilateral cell}
  \label{fig_quadrilateral}
\end{figure}
These two points uniquely defines a linear polynomial. It
should be noted that the line defined does not pass through the quadrilateral
and thus, there is no risk that the denominator equals zero (this is only true
for convex quadrilateral). When the quadrilateral tends to a parallelogram,
the points defining $P_{4,5}$ are moved to the infinity and the value of
$P_{4,5}(x,y)$ with in $(x,y)$ in the cell tends to a constant. By definition
this constant is chosen to be 1 for a parallelogram. For a trapezoid,
$P_{4,5}$ is the line defined by the intersection of the lines generated by
the two edges which are not parallel and parallel to the two parallel edges of
the trapezoid. For arbitrary polygons, a non-trivial generalization is
necessary \cite{Wachspress1975}.
%\red{\cite{Bailey2008a} he disadvantage is that the basis function integrals must
%be done numerically.
%\red{\cite{Wachspress1975} $(r;q)_2|_3$ is the value at point 3 of a quadratic
%  function containing points $r$ and $q$. This value depends on supplementary
%  data which defines the quadratic function $(r;q)_2$. Similarly
%  $[(1;2)_2(3;4)/(1;5)]|_8$ is the value of the indicated rational function
%  at point 8. For quadrilaterals: we look for a function like:
%  \begin{equation}
%    w_1(x,y) = \frac{Q_1}{(2;3)(3;4)}|_1 \frac{(2;3)(3;4)}{Q_1}
%  \end{equation}
%  We therefore seek a linear from $Q_1$ such that:
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item $Q_1\neq 0$ within the quadrilateral
%    \item $\frac{(2;3)(3;4}{Q_1}$ is linear on both $(4;1)$ and $(1;2)$
%  \end{itemize}
%  The first property has far-reaching consequences: we must broaden our vision
%  and look outside the quadrilateral. We observe that all the linear forms
%  appearing in the triangle and parallelogram wedges were determined by the
%  sides of these figures. We shall soon see that the quadrilateral itself
%  reaches out to give us the desired linear form. First, we need the following
%  lemma: \emph{If three lines intersect at a point then the ratio of linear
%  forms which vanish on any two of these lines is constant on the third line.}
%  We choose $Q_1$ so that $(2;3)/Q_1$ is constant on side $(4;1)$ and so that
%  $(3;4)/Q_1$ is constant on side $(4;1)$ and so that $(3;4)/Q_1$ is constant
%  on side $(1;2)$. By the lemma, the first requirement is met if lines
%  $(2;3)$, $(4;1)$, and $Q_1$ have a common point of intersection and the
%  second requirement is met if lines $(3;4)$, $(1;2)$, and $Q_1$ have a common
%  point of intersection. If we define point 5 as the intersection point of
%  lines $(2;3)$ and $(1;4)$ and point 6 as the intersection of $(1;2)$ and
%  $(3;4)$, we find that $Q_1(x,y) = (5;6)$ is the unique line which meets both
%  requirements. For any convex quadrilateral, line $Q_1$ has no point in the
%  quadrilateral. Consistent candidates for all four wedges are:
%  \begin{subequations}
%    \begin{align}
%      &W_1(x,y) = k_1 (2;3)(3;4)/Q_1(x,y)\\
%      &W_2(x,y) = k_2 (3;4)(4;1)/Q_1(x,y)\\
%      &W_3(x,y) = k_3 (4;1)(1;2)/Q_1(x,y)\\
%      &W_4(x,y) = k_4 (1;2)(2;3)/Q_1(x,y)
%    \end{align}
%  \end{subequations}
%  The $k_i$ are chose so that $W_i(x_i,y_i)=1$. As the quadrilateral is
%  deformed into a parallelogram, the exterior diagonal moves to infinity and
%  the associated linear from moves to infinity and the associated linear form
%  becomes more nearly constant within the quadrilateral. We therefore let
%  $Q_1(x,y)=1$ for a parallelogram. For a trapezoid, the exterior diagonal is
%  parallel to the parallel sides and passes through the intersection point of
%  the others two sides. We note that the exterior diagonal is uniquely defined
%  as the lined that intersects the sides of the quadrilateral at all the
%  exterior intersection points of these sides and at no other points.
%A non-trivial generalization is necessary for polygons.} 
\subsection{CFEM-based DFEM}
This method is very similar to the PWLD discretization. The scheme is second
order \cite{Warsa2008}. First, the polygonal cell is divided into simplexes
that we will call sub-call. The simplexes are formed by filling the polygons
with triangles without adding point (type 0) or by the vertices of the
cell and the center of the cell (type 1) cf PWLD. Linear DFEM are built on the 
triangles. If type 1 is used, CFEM-based DFEM is similar to PWLD but whereas
PWLD eliminates the center unknown by setting it equal to a weighted average
of the values at the vertexes, CFEM-based DFEM keeps the additional degree of
freedom as an unknown. Therefore, additional degrees of freedom can be added
to improve the numerical properties. The mass matrix $\bs{M}$ for a given cell
composed of $N$ sub-cells is assembled:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^N \bs{M}_{t_n(u),t_n(v)} + \bs{M}_{n,u,v}, \textrm{ for }
  u=1,2,3, v=1,2,3
\end{equation}
\blue{Loop over the sub-cell, and for each cell $n$:
  \begin{equation}
    \bs{M}_{t_n(u),t_n(v)} = \bs{M}_{n,u,v}
  \end{equation}
}
where $\bs{M}_n$ is the mass matrix of the $n$ sub-cell and $t_n$ is indexing
function which maps the index of the vertices of the sub-cells to the index of
the vertices in the cell. The streaming matrix is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^N \bs{L}_{t_n(u),t_n(v)} + \bs{L}_{n,u,v}, \textrm{ for }
  u=1,2,3, v=1,2,3
\end{equation}
and the matrix $\bs{N}_{i,j}^{(k)} = \bs{n}_k \int_{\partial E_k} B_i(\br)
B_j(\br) d\br$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \bs{N}_{t_n(u),t_n(v)}^{(f_n(l))} = \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      & \bs{N}_{n,u,v}^{(l)}, & \textrm{ if }f_n(l)\neq 0\\
      & 0, & \textrm{ otherwise }
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
    \textrm{ for } l=1,2,3,u=1,2,3,v=1,2,3
\end{equation}
where $f_n(k)$ is an indexing function to map face $k$ of the subelement $n$,
for $n=1,\hdots,N,$ to the faces of the polygon.
\subsection{PWBLD}
PWBLD stands for PieceWise Bi-Linear Discontinuous finite elements. This 
discretization is very similar to the PWLD discretization that we explain
in detail in the next Section. When using PWBLD, the convex polygonal cell is 
divided on quadrilateral instead of triangular for PWLD \cite{Bailey2011}. On 
these quadrilaterals, the basis functions are equivalent to bi-linear functions 
on quadrilaterals. If the cell is quadrilateral, PWBLD finite elements are 
identical to bi-linear discontinuous finite elements.
\subsection{PWLC}
PWLC stands for PieceWise Linear Continuous finite elements. It is a second
order method \cite{Bailey2008}. Unlike Palmer's method, the diffusion equation
discretized by PWLD produces a SPD matrix. The PWL function centered at vertex
$j$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
  b_j(\br) = t_j(\br) + \alpha_{c,j} t_c(\br)
\end{equation}
where the $t_j$ functions are standard linear functions defined triangle by
triangle. For instance, $t_ j$ equals 1 at the $j^{th}$ vertex of the cell and
0 at the $j-1^{th}$ and $j+1^{th}$ vertices. $t_c$ is the hat function which
is equal to one at point $c=(x_c,y_c)$ and 0 at all the vertices, with $x_c =
\sum_{i=0}^{N_v} \alpha_{c,i} x_i$, $y_c = \sum_{i=0}^{N_v} \alpha_{c,i} y_i$,
and $\sum_{i=0}^{N_V} \alpha_{c,i} = 1$. PWLC is a second order method. When
this discretization is applied to the diffusion equation, the system obtained
is SPD.
\subsection{PWLD}
PWLD uses similar basis functions than PWLC but they are defined only on a
element.
