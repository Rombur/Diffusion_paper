\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This paper deals with a discontinuous finite element spatial discretizations of the radiation 
diffusion equation on arbitrary polygonal grids, with and without adaptive mesh refinement. 
Radiation diffusion is an asymptotic limit of the radiation transport equation and can be 
written in the following form:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:radiation_diffusion}
- \div  D(\vr) \grad E(\vr) + \sigma_a(\vr) E(\vr) = Q(\vr) ,
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the radiation energy intensity, $D$ is a diffusion coefficient, $\sigma_a$ is 
an opacity coefficient, and $Q$ is the source.

Several spatial discretizations have been proposed to solve \eqt{eq:radiation_diffusion} on
arbitrary polygons (2D) and polyhedra (3D) \cite{Wachspress,Kuznetsov2004,Palmer2005,Brezzi2005,
LipnikovShashkovSvyatskiy2006,BaileyAdams2008}. We review them below.
%
Wachspress \cite{Wachspress} developed a family of rational polynomial functions that can be employed
as basis functions in a finite element method on polygonal/polyhedral grids. This yields
symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices but (i) the finite element integrals must be carried out 
numerically and (ii) the Jacobian of the transformation becomes zero on degenerate cells 
(such as the ones shown on \fig{fig:amr_schematics}). 
%
%Morel et al. \cite{MorelDendyHallWhite1992} introduced a cell-centered finite volume scheme 
%for arbitrary quadrilateral meshes. Their scheme was second-order accurate and yielded back a 
%standard five-point stencil on orthogonal grids, but the diffusion operator was asymmetric 
%and cell-edge unknowns were added in addition to cell-center unknowns.
%%
Palmer \cite{Palmer2005,PalmerLLNL} proposed a node-based finite volume method 
that enforces particle balance over dual cells, where a dual cell is defined as 
the union of all corners surrounding a given vertex $p$ and where  a corner 
is a quadrilateral defined by vertex $p$, the cell center, and the midpoint
of the edges that contain vertex $p$. On a triangular grid, Palmer's scheme is equivalent 
to linear continuous finite elements with ``mass-matrix lumping''. The method is 
second-order accurate but the discretization of the diffusion equation using Palmer's method 
does not result in SPD matrices.
%
Mimetic finite difference methods create discrete analog of vector and tensor
calculus in order to accurately approximate the original differential operators;
see, e.g., \cite{HymanMorelShashkovSteinberg2002}.
Mimetic methods preserve important properties of the differential operators such 
as symmetry, positivity, monotonicity, asymptotic limits, and identities pertaining 
to tensor and vector calculus. Mimetic methods can also be viewed as mixed hybrid 
finite element formulations with specific spatial quadratures.  
In addition to quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes (see, e.g., 
\cite{MorelRobertsShashkov1998,MorelHallShashkov2001}, mimetic finite difference 
methods have recently been applied to the diffusion equation on arbitrary polygonal 
grids \cite{Kuznetsov2004,Brezzi2005,LipnikovShashkovSvyatskiy2006,LipnikovShashkov2010}.
%conformal quadrilateral \cite{HymanShashkovSteinberg1997, ShashkovSteinberg1996,MorelRobertsShashkov1998} 
%and hexahedral \cite{MorelHallShashkov2001} grids, locally refined grids \cite{LipnikovMorelShashkov2004}, and
%arbitrary polygonal grids \cote{Kuznetsov2004,Brezzi2005,LipnikovShashkovSvyatskiy2006,LipnikovShashkov2010}.

%, scalar and vector inner products, such as: ,
%conservation laws, symmetry preservation, solution positivity and
%monotonicity, and asymptotic limits (e.g., diffusion limit), on polygonal and
%polyhedral meshes. The most important part of MFD is the definition of a scalar
%product which satisfies stability and consistency some conditions
%\cite{Brezzi2005}. However, this scalar product is not unique and therefore,
%multiple MFD methods exists. MFD is efficient even on concave polygons
%\cite{Kuznetsov2004}. MFD methods are related to mixed finite elements.
%
Bailey et al. \cite{BaileyAdams2008} recently employed a piecewise linear basis
functions to solve the diffusion equation using a Galerkin finite element technique on 
arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral grids. Their goal was to devise a continuous finite 
element discretization that does not necessitate numerical integration, yields an SPD matrix, 
and handles arbitrary polygonal/polyhedral grids (including grids with degenerate cells).




In this paper, we are interested in solving the diffusion equation on a
polygonal mesh. First, we want to point the usefulness of using polygonal
cells to discretize the domain of a problem. Such cell type presents a big 
advantage over traditional cells type (triangles and rectangles): polygonal 
cells allow for meshing flexibility. Boundary layer meshes can easily be set 
up, polygonal meshes can be generated from triangular meshes, and polygons 
can be included locally in existing meshes to improve mesh quality. Existing 
meshing tools such as MSTK \cite{mstk} and the Computational Geometry Algorithms 
Library \cite{cgal} may be employed to process polygonal meshes. For 
instance, the radiation transport code PDT and the CFD codes Fluent and OpenFoam 
offer polygonal mesh and solver capabilities. The following features of polygonal
cells are noteworthy:
\begin{description}
  \item[Optimal partition of the space minimizing boundary/interior ratio]
  \item[Reduced number of unknowns:] To illustrate this, we assume
    one unknown per vertex in every cell, which is standard for linear discontinuous
    finite element transport discretizations that perform well in the thick
    diffusive regime. In the 2D hexagonal example of \fig{fig_hex_vs_tri},
    the number of unknowns would be six (one unknown per vertex). Using
    triangular cells, the same hexagon would have to be split into four
    triangles at least (thus 12 unknowns) or possibly six triangles to
    preserve symmetry (thus 18 unknowns in that case). Similarly, using
    quadrilateral cells, the hexagon would be bisected into two quadrilaterals
    at least (8 unknowns), but divisions into three of four quadrilaterals are
    also possible (thus, 12 or 16 unknowns).

      \includegraphics[width=5cm]{hex_tri_cells}
      \caption{Hexagonal cell versus triangle cells}
      \label{fig_hex_vs_tri}
    \end{figure}
  \item[Transition elements and Adaptive Mesh Refinement:] Solvers based on
    arbitrary polyhedral cells can easily handle cells with various number of
    edges. This can be particularly useful for simulations
    with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) \cite{Jessee1998,Baker2002,Wang2010a}, 
    without having to deal with the implementation of data structures to handle 
    hanging nodes \cite{Solin2008,Bangerth2007,Arnold2000}. On \Cref{fig_amr_cells}, 
    the left cell is a pentagon whereas the two cells on the right are 
    quadrilaterals. A method based on a piecewise linear discretization can
    handle locally adapted meshes without any special treatment or further
    approximation of the coupling between cells.

\end{description}
Several discretization methods have been developed for arbitrary polygonal
meshes: Palmer's method \cite{Palmer2001}, mimetic finite differences
\cite{Lipnikov2004,Hyman2002,Kuznetsov2004,Brezzi2005},
Wachspress' rationale finite element \cite{Wachspress1975},
CFEM-based DFEM \cite{Warsa2008}, PWLC \cite{Bailey2008a}, PWLD 
\cite{Stone2003,Bailey2008,Bailey2008a}, and PWBLD \cite{Bailey2011}. In this
research, we focus on using PWLD to discretize the diffusion equation. The
PWLD discretization employs discontinuous finite elements and has been used to
discretize the transport equation. Using it to discretize the diffusion
equation is an important step in order to create a Diffusion Synthetic
Acceleration scheme \cite{Adams2002,Wang2010}.
In \Cref{sec_review}, we review different discretizations that can be used on
polygonal cells to discretize the diffusion equation. In \Cref{sec_ip}, we
use the PWLD finite elements to discretize the diffusion
equation. In \Cref{sec_amr}, we introduce the Adaptive Mesh Refinement
technique (AMR). In \Cref{sec_results}, we show some numerical results. We finish
in \Cref{sec_conc} by giving our conclusions.







An outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:dgfem}, 
we briefly introduce the  high-order Discontinuous Finite Element formulation used for
the  $S_{N}$ transport equation and briefly recall the standard iterative techniques used to
solve the discretized equations. 
%
Section~\ref{sec:error} presents the three error estimators employed in this work: two are based on the
difference between coarse and fine adapted solutions whereas the last estimator only requires one numerical solution at each adaptivity cycle and monitors ``how'' discontinuous the numerical solution is. 
%
In Section~\ref{sec:go-error}, we derive the goal-oriented AMR approach; the goal-oriented error estimators re-use the technology presented in Section~\ref{sec:error} and, therefore, we focus the presentation of the introduction of the importance function and provide some examples of quantities of interest.
%
Section~\ref{sec:mesh-adapt} deals with the adaptivity process itself: selection of mesh cells 
for refinement and coupling between mesh cells of various refinement levels in the context of 
a Discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization with upwinding. 
%
In Section~\ref{sec:results}, 2-D results are presented: a simple homogeneous problem employed to present in details the performance of AMR (Example 1), a searchlight problem (Example 2), a problem with different material opacities (Examples 3--5). Examples 4 and 5 compare the standard and the goal-oriented AMR approaches.
%
We conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} and present an outlook on open questions.

\section{Error Estimation Procedure} \label{sec:error}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In radiation transport and radiative transfer, lower-order spatial schemes are most commonly used. The AMR techniques employed with such schemes typically rely on gradient-based error estimates \cite{Jessee1998380}, with a few exceptions, e.g., \cite{kanschat-rad-transfer-97}, where an adjoint-based estimator is derived.
Here, we wish to obtain error estimates for high-order spatial approximations and, therefore, may not rely on simpler estimates such as the gradient of the solution. We have chosen to follow several approaches to estimate the spatial discretization error and propose three means for controlling the spatial error in $S_N$ calculations. The first technique employs two adapted AMR meshes at each adaptivity cycle: a coarse AMR mesh $\mathbb{T}_h^k$ and a fine AMR mesh $\mathbb{T}_{h/2}^k$ obtained by uniform refinement of $\mathbb{T}_h^k$; in the preceding, $k$ denotes the mesh adaptivity cycle index. Error estimates are obtained using the two solutions computed on $\mathbb{T}_{h}^k$ and $\mathbb{T}_{h/2}^k$. This approach is also discussed in \cite{demko-book1,Solin2004449}. The second error estimation technique proposed here is a simple variant of the above technique, where the coarse solution is not computed but approximated by projecting the finer solution onto the coarser mesh. The third approach presented is heuristic and monitors the inter-element jumps of the solution across elements. We discuss these three error estimates below. For goal-oriented AMR, the estimates 
described here can be re-used ``as is''; see Section~\ref{sec:go-error}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Mesh Adaptation} \label{sec:mesh-adapt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we discuss the refinement criterion and the element coupling 
procedure for any refinement difference level and any polynomial approximation
between elements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Refinement Criteria} \label{sec:error4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The criterion for refinement is defined as follows: an element $K$ of $\mathbb{T}_h^k$ is selected for refinement if
\be
\beta _{K}^{k} \ge \alpha \, \max_{K'\in \mathbb{T}_{h}^k} \left( \beta _{K'}^{k} \right),
\label{eq:criterion}
\ee
where $\alpha$ ($0 < \alpha < 1$) is a user-defined fraction and $\beta$ stands for any of the error estimates ($\mu$, $\eta$, $\zeta$, $\widetilde \mu$, $\widetilde \eta$, and $\widetilde \zeta$)
previously defined in \eqt{eq:error-est1}, \eqt{eq:error-est2}, \eqt{eq:error-jump} or \eqt{eq:error-go}. 
The criterion of \eqt{eq:criterion} focuses the computational effort on elements with the largest errors; for
standard AMR, this tends to naturally equi-distribute the spatial error, whereas for goal-oriented approaches
this aims at reducing the computational effort for a given quantity of interest. 

In order to numerically verify that the proposed error estimates are reliable, a \emph{reference} numerical solution $\mathcal{I}_{0,0}^{\textit{ref}}$ is used to assess the convergence rate of the AMR solutions obtained with any of the proposed error estimates. 
In practice, the reference solution $\mathcal{I}_{0,0}^{\textit{ref}}$ needs to be obtained numerically. To do so, we employ the two-mesh error estimator of \eqt{eq:error-est1} with tighter tolerances, fourth order polynomial approximation and additional adaptivity cycles. 
Hence, we defined a ``true'' approximation error, given in the $L_2$-norm, as follows
%
\be
\varepsilon^k = \sqrt{ \sum_K \int_{K\in \mathbb{T}^{k}_{h}}
\left( \mathcal{I}_{0,0}^{k} - \mathcal{I}_{0,0}^{\textit{ref}}\right) ^{2} },
\label{eq:ref-solu}
\ee
%
where  $\mathcal{I}_{0,0}^{k}$ is the numerical solution (at each mesh adaptivity cycle $k$) obtained with any of the error estimates in \eqt{eq:error-est1}, \eqt{eq:error-est2}, \eqt{eq:error-jump}  or \eqt{eq:error-go}. 


In Section~\ref{sec:results}, we compare the approximation error, \eqt{eq:ref-solu}, as a function of the number of unknowns and CPU time for the following  refinement strategies: (i) uniform mesh refinement, (ii) adaptivity using the jump-based indicators of \eqt{eq:error-jump}, and (iii) adaptivity using the two-mesh error estimates of Eqs. (\ref{eq:error-est1}) and (\ref{eq:error-est2}). The meshes resulting from the various AMR strategies will also be compared.
